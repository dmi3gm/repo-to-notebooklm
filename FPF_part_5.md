  sourceRef: NarrativizationAndNarrativeStudiesPrinciplesFramework@2026-06-30
  targetRef: FPFCorePatternSet@current
  relationFunction: Framework edition dependency
  governedUse: DPF patterns rely on FPF Core relation, source, evaluation, ethics, evidence, assurance, generated-carrier, publication, and refresh owners
  directGoverningPatternRef: E.4.PFR
  dependencyOrEditionEffect: DPF depends on Core; Core has no reverse dependency
  blockedStrongerReading: not Core specialization by dependency and not permission to redefine Core owners
  refreshOrSupersessionCondition: refresh when relevant FPF Core edition changes

  relationFunction: Specialization and pattern-use support
  governedUse: DPF narrows Core structure-to-narrative rendering for narrative studies and teaching uses
  directGoverningPatternRef: A.6.3.NAR
  dependencyOrEditionEffect: DPF inherits Core relation obligations and adds domain checks
  blockedStrongerReading: DPF does not redefine Core A.6.3.NAR, E.17.EFP, source, evidence, ethics, or assurance owners
  sourceReturnCondition: return to Core when a DPF row tries to govern the source-to-rendering relation generally
  refreshOrSupersessionCondition: refresh when A.6.3.NAR changes the Core relation slots or source-return obligations

  governedUse: narrative rendering may select, order, evaluate, or teach a demonstrative slice over a wider constraint-governed unfolding structure
  directGoverningPatternRef: A.22.CGUS
  dependencyOrEditionEffect: DPF depends on Core CGUS distinctions; Core has no reverse dependency on this DPF
  blockedStrongerReading: narrative sequence, learning route, or framework carrier is not the selected unfolding structure by presentation
  sourceReturnCondition: return to A.22.CGUS or the local FPF governing pattern when preserved and lost structure, admissible next form, direct exit, or stop condition is missing
  refreshOrSupersessionCondition: refresh when A.22.CGUS, E.18.3, A.6.3.NAR, or local CGUS block guidance changes

  relationFunction: Source or decision reuse

  governedUse: evaluate one narrative rendering version or learning route for declared use and feed repair to E.23 when values exist
  directGoverningPatternRef: A.19.ECS
  preservationOrAdmissionRef: NarrativeRenderingQualityEvaluationCharacteristicSpace@Context
  blockedStrongerReading: NSTD.6 is not evidence, assurance, admission, publication, gate, decision, or pattern-quality authority
  sourceReturnCondition: return to A.19.ECS or C.16 when object kind, scale, value meaning, or measurement basis is defective
  refreshOrSupersessionCondition: refresh when evaluation floor, characteristics, use, evidence basis, or low-value repair route changes

  sourceRef: NarrativeRenderingQualityEvaluationResult@Context
  targetRef: E.22 and E.23
  relationFunction: Narrative rendering quality-loop transfer
  governedUse: improve one exact narrative rendering version or declared changed slice by rerunning NSTD.6 after repairs
  directGoverningPatternRef: E.23; E.22 when the improvement question needs framing
  preservationOrAdmissionRef: NarrativeRenderingImprovementLoopInput@Context
  blockedStrongerReading: an NSTD.6 low value, style suggestion, prompt retry, or generated variant is not an improvement claim until the changed object version is re-evaluated
  sourceReturnCondition: return to NSTD.6 when object version, declared use, result rows, protected trade-offs, allowed change slice, cost and risk, or expected re-evaluation form is missing
  refreshOrSupersessionCondition: refresh through G.11 when source currentness, reader telemetry, teaching-test evidence, FPF edition, generated-narrative practice, or evaluation characteristic space changes

  governedUse: admit or reject generated narrative output before it is evaluated as narrative rendering or used in teaching
  directGoverningPatternRef: C.35
  preservationOrAdmissionRef: AutomatedNarrativizationAdmissionCase@Context
  blockedStrongerReading: generated fluency, coherence, controllability, or schema compliance is not source authority, evidence, assurance, or admission
  sourceReturnCondition: return to C.35 when produced carrier, described structure, preserved structure, lost structure, or receiving owner is missing

## Refresh Route

Use this route when the package is already being applied and one of its source, evaluation, or carrier assumptions changes.

1. Return to `G.2` when a load-bearing source line is absent, stale, too narrow, contradicted, or used beyond its stated boundary.
2. Return to `NSTD.6` when the evaluated object kind, declared use, value meaning, quality characteristic, evidence basis, or low-value repair route changes.
3. Use `E.22` when the improvement question is underframed: purpose, floor, protected trade-offs, expected evidence, result form, or cost and risk are not explicit.
4. Use `E.23` only for an exact changed narrative rendering version or declared changed slice with `NSTD.6` re-evaluation planned.
5. Use `G.11` refresh when FPF Core edition, generated-narrative practice, reader telemetry, teaching-test evidence, source pack, or the `NSTD.6` evaluation characteristic space changes.
6. Keep test-run publication carriers outside pattern bodies; use them as evidence or examples only through the direct owner named by the claim.
